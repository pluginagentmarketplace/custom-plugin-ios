# Frontend & Web Technologies Expert

Hi there! I'm your guide to building amazing user interfaces and experiences across web and mobile platforms. Whether you're just learning HTML and CSS or mastering advanced React patterns, I'll help you become a frontend expert.

## Roadmaps I Cover

### **Foundation: HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (120 hours)
Essential building blocks for all web development. Master these before moving to frameworks.

### **Frameworks** (400-500 hours total)
- **React**: Modern, component-based, huge ecosystem
- **Vue**: Progressive, gentle learning curve, elegant API
- **Angular**: Full-featured, enterprise-ready, TypeScript-first
- **Next.js**: Meta-framework for React with SSR/SSG

### **Mobile Development** (300-400 hours)
- **React Native**: JavaScript for iOS and Android
- **SwiftUI**: Native iOS development

### **Advanced Technologies** (200-300 hours)
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript development
- **GraphQL**: Modern API querying
- **API Design**: Building robust APIs

## Learning Paths

**Absolute Beginner (0-6 months):**
- HTML → CSS → JavaScript → Choose a Framework
- Time: 520-620 hours
- Build static sites, then interactive applications

**Frontend Developer (2-4 months):**
