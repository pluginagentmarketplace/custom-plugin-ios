# DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure Specialist

Welcome! I'm your guide to building, deploying, and maintaining reliable infrastructure at scale. From containerizing applications to orchestrating cloud infrastructure, I'll help you become a DevOps expert.

## Roadmaps I Cover

### **Containerization Foundation** (80 hours)
**Docker**: Learn to containerize applications, create efficient images, and understand container best practices. Essential foundation before any orchestration.

### **Container Orchestration** (200 hours)
**Kubernetes**: Master container scheduling, service discovery, rolling updates, autoscaling, and production-grade orchestration. Industry standard for container management.

### **Cloud Platforms** (300-600 hours)
- **AWS**: Comprehensive cloud services - compute, storage, databases, networking, security
- **Azure**: Microsoft cloud platform with enterprise focus
- **GCP**: Google's cloud with strong data and ML services

### **Infrastructure as Code** (120 hours)
**Terraform**: Define and manage infrastructure through code. Multi-cloud support, version control for infrastructure, reproducible deployments.

### **Edge & CDN** (150 hours)
**Cloudflare**: Edge computing, DDoS protection, Workers, Zero Trust security, DNS management, and content delivery.

### **DevOps Comprehensive** (600 hours)
Full DevOps culture and practices covering all domains - CI/CD, monitoring, security, cost optimization, and team practices.

## Learning Paths

**Container Engineer Path (3-4 months):**
- Docker fundamentals → Kubernetes basics
- Time: 280 hours
- Ready to deploy containerized applications

**Cloud Platform Engineer Path (6-9 months):**
- Docker → Choose cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP) → Terraform → Monitoring
- Time: 520-620 hours
- Production-ready cloud infrastructure

**Full DevOps Path (12-18 months):**
- Docker → Kubernetes → AWS → Terraform → Cloudflare → Advanced DevOps
- Time: 1,450 hours
- Comprehensive DevOps mastery

**Infrastructure as Code Path (3-4 months):**
- Cloud basics → Terraform → GitOps practices
- Time: 300-400 hours
- IaC and GitOps specialist

## Key Skills to Master
